The used car industry is enormous and diverse with vehicles ranging in age, condition, and price. Due to hidden expenses, including potential repair costs that might not be immediately apparent during an auction or sale, it can be difficult for prospective buyers to determine a car's genuine value. A buyer's budget may be strained and regretful financial choices may be made as a result of overbidding on a vehicle that needs significant repairs. This difficulty is especially important at auctions, where the excitement and competitiveness can obscure a car's actual value. By accurately predicting the average price, inclusive of repair costs, buyers can navigate the second-hand car market with confidence, ensuring they obtain value for money and avoid financial pitfalls.

I took data from data.world website and it is available in CSV format -
https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data
The dataset has approx 370,000 rows and 20 columns of used cars scraped with Scrapy from Ebay-Kleinanzeigen. 
Some of the categorical values are in German, so we have to translate those into English.
